# Points are a simple integer value which are given to "meritable" resources
# according to rules in +app/models/merit/point_rules.rb+. They are given on
# actions-triggered, either to the action user or to the method (or array of
# methods) defined in the +:to+ option.
#
# 'score' method may accept a block which evaluates to boolean
# (recieves the object as parameter)
